Heart attacks, also known as myocardial infarctions, are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Early prediction and intervention can significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden on healthcare systems. Multiple regression analysis is a powerful statistical tool that can help identify and quantify the relationships between various risk factors and the likelihood of a heart attack. In the context of heart attack prediction, the dependent variable could be the occurrence of a heart attack, while the independent variables could include a range of clinical and demographic factors such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, smoking status, and physical activity.

Here, I have built a LinearRegression model with the training and testing data.
